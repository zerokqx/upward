# Migration Guide

How to migrate to FSD v2.1 from either FSD v2.0 or a custom (non-FSD)
architecture. This guide reflects the official `from-custom` step order:
**pages first**, then everything else.

The steps reveal where code already belongs; they are not a folder rename
script. Where a step names a destination, the placement rules in
`SKILL.md` still decide whether the code goes there.

## Part 1: FSD v2.0 → v2.1 (non-breaking)

The v2.1 update emphasizes **"pages first"**: most logic stays in pages,
reusable foundation in Shared. When a stable responsibility is genuinely
shared by several consumers and needs one authoritative home, move that
responsibility to the layer below. The migration is non-breaking and simplifies
the codebase by relocating single-use code back to where it is consumed.

Another addition in v2.1 is the standardization of cross-imports between
entities with the `@x` notation. See `references/cross-import-patterns.md`.

### Step 1. Audit existing slices

Use Steiger to detect slices that are used in only one place:

```bash
npm install -D @feature-sliced/steiger
npx steiger src
```

Look for these rules:

- **`insignificant-slice`**: a slice with no references, or with one,
  which it suggests merging into the layer above. Pages may have a single
  reference without being flagged, and so may slices used only from `app`.
- **`excessive-slicing`**: too many slices in a single layer.

For each flagged slice, decide:

- Several consumers, a stable and focused responsibility, and a reason to
  change of its own → leave it where it is.
- One consumer → mark it to move back into that consumer.
- Several consumers, but the copies would rather drift apart → local
  copies may still be the better answer
  (`references/growth-walkthrough.md`, Snapshot 1).

### Step 2. Move single-use code back to its consumer

Move a single-reference feature or entity back into its sole consumer
when the boundary no longer earns its own slice. That consumer is usually
a page; it can be another feature, or an existing widget in a project that
keeps its widgets layer:

```text
// Before (v2.0): feature used by only one page
features/user-profile-form/
  ui/ProfileForm.tsx
  model/profile-form.ts
  api/update-profile.ts
  index.ts
pages/profile/
  ui/ProfilePage.tsx       ← Thin wrapper, just composes

// After (v2.1): code lives in the page that owns it
pages/profile/
  ui/{ProfilePage,ProfileForm}.tsx
  model/profile.ts          ← Merged form logic
  api/update-profile.ts
  index.ts
```

For each moved slice:

1. Copy all files into the consuming page.
2. Update the page's `index.ts` to export what is needed externally.
3. Update all imports across the codebase to point to the new location.
4. Delete the now-empty feature/entity directory.
5. Run tests.

### Step 3. Keep genuinely reused code in place

A slice that passed the check above stays in features/entities. Do not
move it. The point of v2.1 is reducing premature extraction, not removing
reuse.

### Step 4. Deprecate the processes layer

The `processes` layer is deprecated. Migrate its code:

- **Multi-page workflows** (checkout, onboarding wizard): move
  orchestration logic to the page that initiates the workflow. If the
  workflow is a stable user-action boundary that several pages reuse, it
  may become a feature.
- **Background processes** (polling, sync): move to `app/` if global, or
  to the relevant page/feature if scoped.

```text
// Before
processes/
  checkout/model/checkout-flow.ts
  sync/model/background-sync.ts

// After
features/checkout/model/checkout-flow.ts    ← Stable flow, reused
app/sync/background-sync.ts                  ← Global concern
```

### Post-migration verification

1. Run `npx steiger src` and work through what it reports. For each
   single-reference slice, decide whether the boundary is still
   intentional or whether it survived only because it predates the
   migration.
2. Verify import directions. No upward or same-layer cross-imports.
3. Check that no empty layer directories remain.
4. Update documentation to reflect the new structure.

## Phasing out a small widgets layer (optional)

The widgets layer is discouraged, but this migration is optional. A project
with an established widgets layer that works well can keep it as is (see
`references/layer-structure.md`). This section is for projects with only a
few widgets that want to align with the recommended structure.

Route each widget individually by its actual responsibility:

1. **Used by one page only** → inline it into that page's slice. This is the
   most common case: the block was extracted prematurely and never reused.
2. **Contains a user action reused across pages** (a form, a dialog, a
   toolbar with behavior) → move both the action and its UI to `features/`.
3. **Pure presentational UI with no business context** → move to `shared/ui/`.
4. **App-wide shell or layout** (header, footer, navigation frame) → move to
   `app/`, and compose it in the route configuration.
5. **Composes multiple features** → move the composition up into the page or
   the route layout in `app` instead of keeping a middle layer.

Migrate one widget per commit, updating its imports as you go. Delete the
`widgets/` directory (and its path alias) only when the last widget is gone.
A half-empty widgets layer is fine in the meantime; import rules keep
working throughout.

## Part 2: custom architecture → FSD

This part follows the official `from-custom` migration order. The core
philosophy is **pages first**: start by dividing the code by pages, then
work outward.

### Before you start

The most important question to ask the team is: *do you really need it?*
Some projects are perfectly fine without FSD. Reasons to consider the
switch:

1. New team members struggle to reach a productive level.
2. Modifications to one part of the code **often** break unrelated parts.
3. Adding new functionality is difficult due to the volume of context to
   hold in mind.

**Avoid switching to FSD against the will of teammates**, even as a lead.
Convince the team that the benefits outweigh migration and learning costs.
Explain the migration plan to management; architectural changes are not
immediately observable to them.

If the decision is made, set up a path alias for `src/` first. This guide
uses `@` as an alias for `./src`.

### Step 1. Divide the code by pages

If `pages/` already exists, skip this step. Otherwise, create `pages/` and
move as much component code as possible from `routes/` (or equivalent) into
it. Aim for tiny route files that just re-export from page slices.

```text
// Route file (thin)
src/routes/products.[id].js
  export { ProductPage as default } from "@/pages/product"

// Page slice
src/pages/product/
  ui/ProductPage.jsx
  index.js                ← export { ProductPage } from "./ProductPage.jsx"
```

Pages may reference each other for now. Tackle that later. Focus on
establishing a prominent division by pages.

### Step 2. Separate everything else from pages

This step is a staging move, not the final ownership rule. Business
code will land in `shared/` here, and Step 4 pulls it back out. Do not
read "does not import pages" as a reason for code to live in Shared.

Create `src/shared/` and move everything that does **not** import from
`pages/` or `routes/` there. Create `src/app/` and move everything that
**does** import the pages or routes there, including the routes themselves.

The Shared layer has no slices, so segments may import from each other.

```text
src/
  app/
    routes/
      products.jsx
      products.[id].jsx
    App.jsx
    index.js
  pages/
    product/
      ui/ProductPage.jsx
      index.js
    catalog/
  shared/
    actions/, api/, components/, containers/, constants/,
    i18n/, modules/, helpers/, utils/, reducers/, selectors/, styles/
```

### Step 3. Tackle cross-imports between pages

Find all cases where one page imports from another. Resolve each in one of
two ways:

1. **Copy-paste** the imported code into the depending page to remove the
   dependency.
2. **Move to a Shared segment**:
   - UI kit code → `shared/ui/`
   - configuration constants → `shared/config/`
   - backend interaction → `shared/api/`

Copy-pasting is **not architecturally wrong**. Sometimes it is more correct
to duplicate than to abstract into a new reusable module, because the
shared parts of pages can drift apart over time. Still, the DRY principle
holds for business logic: avoid copy-pasting code that must stay in sync
across multiple places.

### Step 4. Unpack the Shared layer

The Shared layer can become bloated after Step 2. Find every object used in
only one page and move it to that page's slice. **This applies to actions,
reducers, and selectors too.** There is no benefit in grouping all actions
together, but there is benefit in colocating relevant actions close to
their usage.

```text
src/
  pages/
    product/
      actions/, reducers/, selectors/, ui/   ← moved from shared
      index.js
    catalog/
  shared/                                    ← shared infrastructure only
    actions/, api/, components/, ...
```

### Step 5. Organize code by technical purpose (segments)

In FSD, division by technical purpose is done with **segments**. The common
ones are:

- **`ui`**: everything related to UI display (components, date formatters,
  styles).
- **`api`**: backend interactions (request functions, data types, mappers).
- **`model`**: the data model (schemas, interfaces, stores, business
  logic).
- **`lib`**: library code that other modules in the slice need.
- **`config`**: configuration files and feature flags.

Custom segments are allowed when needed. **Do not create segments that
group code by what it is**, like `components`, `actions`, `types`, or
`utils`. Group code by what it is **for**, not by what it is. This is the
desegmentation principle.

Reorganize each page to separate code by segments:

- The existing page UI files become the `ui` segment.
- Actions, reducers, selectors, and the rest of the state wiring become
  the `model` segment.
- Request functions become the `api` segment, and so does a thunk that
  carries its own request. Once the request is separated out, the Redux
  wiring left behind belongs with the reducer in `model`
  (`references/state-management.md`).

Reorganize the Shared layer too:

- `components/`, `containers/` → most of it becomes `shared/ui/`.
- `helpers/`, `utils/` → group by function (dates, type conversions, etc.)
  and move groups to `shared/lib/`.
- `constants/` → group by function and move to `shared/config/`.

## Optional steps

### Step 6. Form entities/features from Redux slices used on several pages

A slice's subject does not settle its layer. Reused Redux slices typically
describe business concepts (products, users) or user actions (comments,
likes), and the official step says such a slice **can** move:

- A stable, reusable business-domain responsibility may become an entity,
  one entity per folder.
- A complete, reusable user interaction with a stable boundary may become
  a feature.
- Anything single-use or still unclear stays with the page that uses it.

Entities and features are meant to be independent. If your business domain
contains inherent connections between entities (a song belongs to an
artist), see the
[business entities cross-references guide](https://fsd.how/docs/guides/examples/types#business-entities-and-their-cross-references).

API functions related to these slices can stay in `shared/api`.

### Step 7. Refactor your modules

Do not map `modules/` onto `features/`. A legacy `modules/` folder usually
holds several kinds of code at once, so read each module by its
responsibility and its consumers: a screen-specific block stays in
`pages/`, a reusable action plus its UI goes to `features/`, a stable
reused domain rule goes to `entities/`, infrastructure goes to `shared/`,
and an app-wide shell (header, footer) goes to `app/`. Some modules
describe large UI chunks; a project that keeps its widgets layer can
migrate those there.

### Step 8. Form a clean UI foundation in `shared/ui`

`shared/ui` should contain UI elements with no encoded business logic.
Refactor components from `components/` and `containers/` to extract their
business logic to higher layers. Where no stable shared boundary has
appeared and the copies can evolve apart, keeping the behavior local to
each consumer is an acceptable choice.

## Common pitfalls during migration

1. **Extracting too early.** Wait for real reuse, not anticipated reuse.
   The v2.1 philosophy is "pages first, extract later".
2. **Creating empty layers.** Do not create `features/` or `entities/`
   directories until there is content for them, and do not actively adopt
   the discouraged `widgets/` layer.
3. **Refactoring while migrating.** Separate relocation from refactoring.
   Move files first, improve them in separate commits.
4. **Ignoring import direction.** Enforce import rules from day one with
   ESLint or Steiger.
5. **Big-bang migration.** Migrate page by page, verifying each step. A
   hybrid structure (partly FSD, partly legacy) is acceptable during
   transition.
6. **Grouping by technical role.** `components/`, `actions/`, `utils/` as
   segment names defeat the purpose of FSD. Group by what code is for.

## Migrating from FSD v1 to v2

This guide does not cover v1 → v2. See the official
[v1 to v2 migration guide](https://fsd.how/docs/guides/migration/from-v1).
The v1 → v2 transition introduced the entities and processes layers
(processes was later deprecated in v2.1).

# Reactuse

This skill is a decision-and-implementation guide for reactuse library for react.js / next.js projects. It maps requirements to the most suitable reactuse hook, applies the correct usage pattern, and prefers hook-based solutions over bespoke code to keep implementations concise, maintainable, and performant.

## When to Apply

- Apply this skill whenever assisting development work in React.js / Next.js.
- Always check first whether a reactuse hook can implement the requirement.
- Prefer reactuse hooks over custom code to improve readability, maintainability, and performance.
- Map requirements to the most appropriate hook and follow the hook’s invocation rule.
- Please refer to the `Invocation` field in the hooks table. For example:
  - `AUTO`: Use automatically when applicable.
  - `EXTERNAL`: Use only if the user already installed the required external dependency; otherwise reconsider, and ask to install only if truly needed.
  - `EXPLICIT_ONLY`: Use only when explicitly requested by the user.
    > _NOTE_ User instructions in the prompt or `AGENTS.md` may override a hook’s default `Invocation` rule.

## Hooks

All hooks listed below are part of the [reactuse](https://reactuse.org/) library. Each section categorizes hooks based on their functionality.

IMPORTANT: Each hook entry includes a short `Description` and a detailed `Reference`. When using any hook, always consult the corresponding document in `./references` for usage details and type declarations.

Blocked upstream category: Reactuse also exports `Humor` hooks (`useFul`, `useLess`, `useOnce`) in recent releases. This skill intentionally does not support or recommend them because upstream marks them as jokes or non-production utilities.

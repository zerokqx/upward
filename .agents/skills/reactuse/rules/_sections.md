## Blocked Upstream Categories

Reactuse exports a `Humor` category in recent releases, currently `useFul`, `useLess`, and `useOnce`. Keep it blocked for this skill: do not add those rules or recommend those hooks unless the user explicitly asks to document unsupported upstream exports. Upstream marks them as jokes or non-production utilities.
